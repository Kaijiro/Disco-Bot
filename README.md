# Disco-Bot
Hello and welcome to the Disco Bot repository !

Disco Bot is a Discord bot that aim to play music in your channel, but there's more to discover !
- Created by Kaijiro

## Why ?
I created this bot "just for fun", I wanted to create a bot just because Discord's APIs seems fun to me :)

## What is Disco Bot able to do ?
Disco Bot is ... not able to play music. What a shame. Playing music is the next step of my developpements 
as I'm playing slowly with those APIs.

For now, Disco Bot is able to :
- Log user's status changes into a given channel
- Choose the channel in chich Disco Bot log those events.
- And .... that's all. For now !

## Is Disco Bot deployed to run 24/7 ?
Not yet, but I'm planning to do it soon.
